          <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
          <p>
            The integration of digital technologies into higher education, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic,
            has transformed every aspect of teaching and learning mathematics. This workshop explores challenges
            and opportunities brought by this transformation, including strategies to enhance student engagement
            using platforms such as VLE, and ways to deliver meaningful online content, feedback, and formative
            assessment.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll explore evidence-based strategies, tools like gamification, and adaptive learning platforms to
            personalise experiences and improve outcomes. The workshop also investigates the role of feedback and
            formative assessment in digital education, seeking innovative methods beyond automated grading.
          </p>
          <p><strong>This workshop is funded by IMA (Institute of Mathematics and its Applications).</strong></p>
